### **JOIN US**
Three postdoc positions are available in the Computational Soft Matter and Biomaterials group at [the Wenzhou Institute, University of Chinese Academy of Science](http://www.wibe.ac.cn). (One can spend some time in Grenoble (France), to collaborate with [Dr. Romain Mari](https://rmari.github.io).) We seek motivated researchers of simulation modeling in soft matter, biophysics, and biomaterials.
1. Directions
- Suspension rheology and fluid mechanics 
- Coarse-grained simulations for soft matter systems
- Active matter
1. Conditions
- Salary: about 320K RMB per year
- Term: 2 years (needs to be more than 21 months, and possible to extend)
- [see also here (in Chinese)](http://www.wiucas.ac.cn/hr/2020/272.html).
1. Requirements
- Doctoral degree in soft matter, statistical physics, fluid mechanics, and biophysics, etc.
- Experience with numerical simulations
- Programming skills (C++, python, etc.)
1. Please send the following items to [me](mailto:seto@wibe.ac.cn) 
- CV 
- List of publications
- Summary of your research accomplishments and your research interests
- Contact information of references
