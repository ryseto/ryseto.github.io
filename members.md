Three postdoc positions are available in the Computational Soft Matter and Biomaterials group at [the Wenzhou Institute, University of Chinese Academy of Science](http://www.wibe.ac.cn). We seek motivated researchers of simulation modeling in soft matter, biophysics, and biomaterials. 
- Suspension rheology and fluid mechanics 
- Coarse-grained simulations for soft matter systems (colloids, gels, polymer, emulsion, etc.)
- Active matter
- One postdoc is expected to work in the collaboration with [Dr. Romain Mari](https://rmari.github.io) (He or she can spend some time in Grenoble, France).

Conditions
- Salary: about 320K RMB per year
- Term: 2 years (needs to be more than 21 months, and possible to extend)
