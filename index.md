The research focuses of The Computational Soft Matter and Biomaterials Group
include suspension rheology, biomechanics, ceramics, active matter,
and non-Newtonian fluid mechanics.
We develop particle and continuum simulations to study dissipative particle dynamics in driven states and non-Newtonian fluid mechanics.


### **Announcement** 
We are currently seeking postdoctoral researcher(s) in The Computational Soft Matter and Biomaterials Group in the [Wenzhou Institute of UCAS](http://www.wibe.ac.cn). Our research projects include computational fluid mechanics for suspension, computational modeling for biomaterials, and active matter. please [contact me](mailto:seto@wibe.ac.cn).

### **What's New!** 
- 2020.03 Preprint about [rolling friction in suspension rheology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10996)
