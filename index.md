PI researcher at [Wenzhou Institute, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.wibe.ac.cn)\\
[中国科学院大学温州研究院](http://www.wibe.ac.cn)
	

The research focuses of The Computational Soft Matter and Biomaterials group
include suspension rheology, biomechanics, ceramics, active matter,
and non-Newtonian fluid mechanics.
We develop particle and continuum simulations to study dissipative particle dynamics in driven states and non-Newtonian fluid mechanics.
