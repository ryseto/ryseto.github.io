We study the mechanical properties of functional soft materials using computer simulation. Our research focuses on the rheology of complex fluids. We aim to develop simulations to capture mesoscale dynamics, which determine structures in nonequilibrium conditions, such as driven systems or biological systems. One of our goals is to introduce soft-matter physics insights in biomaterials sciences and biology. We are also interested in investigating colloidal phenomena for medical applications.

### **Announcement** 
We are currently seeking postdoctoral researcher(s) in The Computational Soft Matter and Biomaterials Group in the [Wenzhou Institute of UCAS](http://www.wibe.ac.cn). Our research projects include computational fluid mechanics for suspension, computational modeling for biomaterials, and active matter. please [contact me](mailto:seto@wibe.ac.cn) and [see here](http://www.wiucas.ac.cn/hr/2020/272.html)

### **What's New!** 
- 2020.03 Preprint about [rolling friction in suspension rheology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10996). This work is done in collaboration with Abhinendra Singh (first author), Christopher Ness, Juan J de Pablo, and Heinrich M Jaeger!
