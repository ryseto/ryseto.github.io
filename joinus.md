Postdoc positions are available in the Computational Soft Matter group at [the Wenzhou Institute, University of Chinese Academy of Science](http://www.wiucas.ac.cn). We seek motivated researchers of simulation modeling in soft matter, rheology, and biophysics.
1. Directions
- Fluid mechanics of dense suspensions (Suspension balance model)
- Coarse-grained simulations for soft matter systems
- Active matter
1. Conditions
- Only Chinese (This temporal condition is due to the difficulty of the current pandemic situation)
- Salary: see [here](http://www.wiucas.ac.cn/hr/2020/272.html)
- Term: 2 years (needs to be more than 21 months, and possible to extend)
1. Requirements
- Doctoral degree in soft matter, statistical physics, fluid mechanics, and biophysics, etc.
- Experience with numerical simulations
- Programming skills (C++, Python, etc.)
1. Please send the following items to [me](mailto:seto@wibe.ac.cn) 
- CV 
- List of publications
- Summary of your research accomplishments and your research interests
- Contact information of references
