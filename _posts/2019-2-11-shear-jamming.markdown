The phenomenon of shear-induced jamming is a factor in the complex rheological behavior of dense suspensions. Such shear-jammed states are fragile, i.e., they are not stable against applied stresses that are incompatible with the stress imposed to create them. This peculiar flow-history dependence of the stress response is due to flow-induced microstructures. To examine jammed states realized under constant shear stress, we perform dynamic simulations of non-Brownian particles with frictional contact forces and hydrodynamic lubrication forces. We find clear signatures that distinguish these fragile states from the more conventional isotropic jammed states.
