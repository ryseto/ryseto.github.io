<p>We updated <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04361">our paper on shear jamming</a>, i.e., the emergence of rigidity due to flow. This work tests the fragility concept in Cates et al. 1998 with a stress-controlled algorithm to impose shear strains.
Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/v5LKX8bpP-w">simulation movie</a> included as Supplemental Material.
