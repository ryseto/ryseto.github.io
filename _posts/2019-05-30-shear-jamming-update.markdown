Updated [our paper on shear jamming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04361), i.e., the emergence of rigidity due to flow. We test the fragility concept in Cates et al. 1998 with a stress-controlled algorithm to impose shear strains.

We added an [animation movie](https://youtu.be/v5LKX8bpP-w) as Supplemental Material.
