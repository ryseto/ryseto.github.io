We updated [our paper on shear jamming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04361), i.e., the emergence of rigidity due to flow. This work tests the fragility concept in Cates et al. 1998 with a stress-controlled algorithm to impose shear strains.
Here is a [simulation movie](https://youtu.be/v5LKX8bpP-w) included as Supplemental Material.
